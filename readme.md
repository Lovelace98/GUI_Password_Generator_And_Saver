**This project used Tkinter to build a full GUI password generator and saver**

## PROBLEM
I didnt want to use paid services to be keeping track of my randomly generated passwords I use for different websites. It is costly and saving money isnt a terrible idea

## SOLUTION
I built a local desktop application using Tkinter to generate a randomized password. This app also has a save feature where I can enter the name of a website, the password required to access that website and save it locally in a json file. With this i saved money and enhanced my python skills.
