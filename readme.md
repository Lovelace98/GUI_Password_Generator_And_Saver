**This project used Tkinter to build a full GUI password generator and saver**

## PROBLEM

In today's digital age, maintaining secure and unique passwords for various websites is crucial to protect our online accounts from unauthorized access. However, relying on paid services or using the same password for multiple sites can pose significant security risks and its costly too. To address this problem, I developed a comprehensive GUI password generator and saver.

## SOLUTION

The password application I created is a user-friendly tool that eliminates the need for paid services and simplifies the process of generating and storing passwords for different websites. The application offers the following features:

1. Password Generation: The application provides a built-in password generator that can create strong and random passwords. This ensures that each password generated is unique and highly secure, reducing the risk of password breaches.

2. Website Information: Users can input the name of the website, along with their username or email associated with that particular website. This information is necessary to keep track of the different accounts and their corresponding credentials.

3. Password Storage: The application automatically creates a local JSON file to store all the passwords and usernames for various websites. This file serves as a secure repository, ensuring that your sensitive information remains encrypted and accessible only to you.

By utilizing this password generator and saver, you can take control of your online security without relying on external services. The application provides a convenient and efficient solution for managing passwords, allowing you to maintain strong and unique credentials for each website you use.
